## Stack Overflow Knockoff Assignment

In this 2-day assignment creating a stack overflow-esque web application, the goal was to break into teams, create appropriate associations, use ActiveRecord to make a database, and Sinatra (instead of Rails) to do the routing, etc. We had just learned about jQuery and Ajax earlier in the week; this was our first project with which to utilize them. Users can create secure accounts, post questions, post comments to those questions; post answers, post comments to those answers; upvote and downvote; and so forth. The theme was meant to be lighthearted and fun; other groups did "Hipster Overflow", "Stack Undertow", etc.
